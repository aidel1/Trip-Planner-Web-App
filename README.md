# Trip-Planner-Web-App
Capstone project for my Computer Science degree. Built in a team using Python, Django, and SQL for full-stack trip planning functionality.

## Features
- Specify trip details (name, destination, dates, group size, budget)  
- Select a hotel and restaurants  
- Choose activities across eight categories (Sightseeing, Museum Tours, Wine Tasting, Cycling, Boat Cruise, Shopping, Food Tasting, Hiking)  
- Automatically generate a balanced, round-robin itinerary  
- View a detailed trip summary and save past trips  

## Tech Stack

## About This Project

My contributions included:
- Designing the front-end with Django templates and CSS
- Implementing hotel and restaurant booking features
- Integrating dynamic destination logic and styling


**Note**: The initial prototype generated itineraries using AI prompts. For clarity and ease of deployment, all AI logic was replaced with a deterministic, rule-based generator, making the code fully transparent and easy to maintain.
